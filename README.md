# LoR-discord-bot

## WIP
Learning how to make a discord bot :) This is a Legends of Runeterra Discord bot.
There is currently a typo with how Riot named their region image, its spelled "zuan" when its supposed to be "zaun".

### Current Functionality:
- Getting card info
- Getting keyword info
- Getting full card art
- Basic API info (local player current match, last match, deck)

### This bot requires a config.json with these values:
- token: bot's auth token
- prefix: the prefix for bot commands (ie "!" if the commands are "!cardname zed")
- ownerID: your discord id
- corepackageurl: "https://dd.b.pvp.net/datadragon-core-en_us.zip"
- setbundlefullurl: "https://dd.b.pvp.net/datadragon-set1-en_us.zip"
- globals: "./data/core-en-us/en_us/data/globals-en_us.json"
- regionIcons: "./data/core-en-us/en_us/img/regions/"
- set: "./data/set-full/en_us/data/set1-en_us.json"
- cardArt: "./data/set-full/en_us/img/cards/"
